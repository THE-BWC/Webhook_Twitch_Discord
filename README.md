# Twitch Discord Webhook
A simple node.js application that monitors BWC Members' Twitch channels for new streams and posts them to a Discord channel using a webhook.

## Requirements
- Twitch API (https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16.9.0 or higher)
- NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (should be installed with Node.js)
- PM2 (https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) (Optional) - Used to run the application as a service.
- A Discord channel with a webhook.
- A list of BWC Members' Twitch usernames.

## Installation
### Run in terminal
1. Download the latest release from the releases page.
2. Extract the zip file to a directory of your choice.
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the zip file.
4. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. Run `npm run start` to start the application.
6. The application will now be running in the terminal window. You can close the terminal window if you wish.
7. To stop the application, press `CTRL + C` in the terminal window.

### Run as a service
1. Download the latest release from the releases page.
2. Extract the zip file to a directory of your choice.
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the zip file.
4. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. Run `pm2 start ecosystem.config.json` to start the application as a service. You can then use `pm2 stop <name>/<id>` to stop the application, and `pm2 restart name>/<id>` to restart the application.
6. If you wish to run the application as a service on startup, you can use PM2 to do so. Run `pm2 startup` to generate the startup command for your system. Then run the command that was generated to enable PM2 to run on startup. Then run `pm2 save` to save the current PM2 configuration. You can then use `pm2 stop name>/<id>` to stop the application, and `pm2 restart name>/<id>` to restart the application.

## Configuration
### config.json
1. Open the `config.json` file in a text editor.
2. Replace the `message` value with the message you want to be sent to the Discord channel.
3. Add the members channel id to the `Streamers` array.
4. Save the `config.json` file.

### ecosystem.config.json
1. Open the ecosystem.config.json file in a text editor.
2. Replace the `CLIENT_ID` value with your Twitch API Client ID.
3. Replace the `CLIENT_SECRET` value with your Twitch API Client Secret.
4. Replace the `WEBHOOK_URL` value with the webhook url for your Discord channel.
5. Save the `ecosystem.config.json` file.

### Notes
- The `message` value supports Discord markdown.
- You can find the members' usernames by going to their Twitch channel and copying the last part of the URL. For example, the username for https://www.twitch.tv/bradleyw is `bradleyw`.

## Logging
